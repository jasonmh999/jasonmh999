My friend and I discovered QBasic early in high school (back in the 90's) and fell in love with programming. Next came Pascal, C, and C++. I won a state-wide programming contest in high school and then my college-wide context my first year. Then at ACM Southeast, our team placed third in our division.

Out of college, I worked at a company that produced factsheets and financial reports for companies such as Merrill Lynch. It took in their financial data and using Foxpro and MySQL produced postscript code to create pdf's. This all had to be legally compliant, on-time and had constantly evolving needs (new regulatory footnotes, new pie charts, new languages, countries, etc.). More, it was developed by a sole developer without best practices (no tests, no refactoring--something like changing one regulatory footnote for a fund might mean changing the third, fifth, and eighth case statements of a massive switch statement). That developer left suddenly and I was left as the sole person in charge of managing the code base. This meant working with our in-house teams (translation, fact checking, etc.) and working with the clients' non-technical representatives to translate their desire outcomes into a finished product, all the while keeping the whole thing running smoothly and filing on-time reports.

So what happened next? Long story short, I had always loved the humanities as well and left to pursue other interests. I always kept in touch with the tech world, reading blogs, trying out things like Python, and I'm excited to be transitioning back. I'm hitting the books and working through various programming challenges, some of which are in repositories here. Reach out if you're hiring, want to collaborate on something, or would like help learning yourself. Take care!
